Taking a look into the relationships among smoking, poverty, and nutritional deficiency. 
Smoking has been associated with poverty rate and nutritional deficiency, especially in poor areas. Some scholars argue that the poor households spending on tobacco reduces spending on basic necessities, including foods, which eventually leads them to be more financially vulnerable.

This context is especially relevant in Indonesia as one of the biggest tobacco consumers markets in the world.

This report aims to provide high-level analysis on poverty, smoking rate, and nutritional deficiency data on Indonesian provinces. Specifically, we will take a look at the relationship among those variables using descriptive statistics.
